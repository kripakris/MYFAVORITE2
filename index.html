       <div class="line"></div>
    <p>I really like the movie "The Beauty And The Beast" especially the character named Belle.
        Belle had saved many people around her;her father, the Beast, and all of the servants in the 
        castle. She was kind, hardworking, brave, thoughtful that she could break the curse and save all.
        Even the Beast was able to change and become a kind man and while all the other Disney princesses
        have positive qualities worth emulating, she was the only princess who encouraged reading and
        learning.She also very confident and outspoken in her opinions.
